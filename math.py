Why Economics
Although i am pursuing science at my UG at India Premier science institue,i.e IISc.
I have realized,during my sophomore years,that paths to solve human problems in today's 
complex worlds are interdescplinery in nature and economics is the one of the most suitable 
subject which can directly be applied to change the state of human kind.

After realizing my passion to serve and to solve human problem in an impactful ways,I am  convinced that subject of economics is relevent
in every aspect of human lives. To pursue of interst and passion I have taken graduate level course of Macroeconomics
at Management Dept of my college and have topped the class,unfortunately  university allow only one course to credit at the management dept for the undergraduates
,i have audited courses such as Game Theory and completed many courses relating to econometrics,microeconimics and macroeconomics at Coursera and EDX.
As part of undergraduates coursework i have taken courses of probablity and statitics,linear algebra,calculas,real analysis.

little about myself 
i have cracked one of the toughest exam of india,KVPY when i was at class 11 and got admitted into india's best university,IISc at its flagship four year,BS program.
The acedemics rigrous of IISc in its curriculam and my curiosity towards social sciences have better  prepared me to pursue my interst in economics at Graduate level.
